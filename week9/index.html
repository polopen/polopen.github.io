Who am I to write a poem? <br>
Am I a poet, perhaps? <br>
A <span id="student">student</span>? An author? <br>
Shall I compare thee to <span id="summer">a summer&#39;s day</span>? <br>
High school <span id="highschool">English</span> class was never my <br>
forte. <br>
â€¦anyway, <br>
<span id="denial">Denial</span> is not a river in Egypt. <br>
Far from, actually. <br>
Or maybe that's just <br>
the Niall. <br>
A member of One Direction. <br>
North, South, East, West <br>
Those are in fact, <br>
four <br>
directions. <br>
Where was I going with this? <br>
To school? To <span id="work">work</span>? Egypt? <br>
...well, it&#39;s not like I can leave home <br>
anyway. <br>
Deuces. <br>
