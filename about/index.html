	<p> Hey there! My name is Jessica Garcia and I'm an undergraduate student at Hunter College in New York City. I'm currently in my 6th year, hoping to graduate this May with Bachelors degrees in both Childhood Education and Media Studies.<br> Not only would I like to explore media as another medium of storytelling, but I think it can also be a powerful tool to channel, translate, and interpret different ideas. And as a future educator, I'm an advocate for hands-on learning; and using play as an instrument of understanding. So far in my studies, I've had the opportunity to toy with physical computing, film production, digital design, and web programming to add on my creative toolbelt. I would like to apply these skills as a way of bridging the gap between the STEM field and the arts, and collaborating with others to build a community of ideas and advocate for the public. </p>
